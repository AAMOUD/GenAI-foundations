# GenAI-foundations
This repository contains practical exercises and projects designed to explore foundational concepts of Generative AI, including Markov Chains, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), and Naive Bayes classifiers. Each project demonstrates the application of these techniques using Python and popular libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn.
